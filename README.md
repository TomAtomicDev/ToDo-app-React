# My Tasks | To-Do app 
#### by TomAtomic.dev
***
This is a minimalistic To-Do app build using React.js, to write down the list of To-Dos you have pending. 

In this app you can:
- Create a new task using the '+' button
- Mark tasks as completed
- Delete a task if required
- Check how many tasks you have completed from the total number of tasks.
- Search tasks by any word or letter contained in the task, even if it is marked as complete.
- This app is responsive, so you can use it on different devices like phones, tablets, small and large computers. 

**Important:** The list of tasks will be stored on the cache memory of your computer, no server or DataBase has been used. I will still be there even if you turn off your computer, but if you erase the navigation data of your browser it will be deleted.

## How did I build the App?
***
This is a project for my personal portafolio that aims to demostrate habilities and expertice using the React.js framework. The main structure has been built thanks to the guide provided on the **Platzi course: Introduction to React.js**. Here you can check [My platzi certificates](https://platzi.com/p/TomAtomic/) in Web Development and other interesting subjects.

In this project I used:
- React: v.18.0.0
- Create React App
- React Components
- Render Props
- High Order Components
- ReactDOM and Reactivity
- Lists and Keys, Forms
- React Hooks: useEffect, useState, useContext
- Customs React Hooks: useLocalStorage
- Loading Skeletons (to simulate conection to a server)
- React-icons library
